**Multi Atlas Skull Stripping (MASS)**
[`ARAD2013 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1076633213004182>`__], 
is a software package designed for robust and accurate brain extraction, applicable for both individual as well as large population studies.

MASS is implemented as a Unix command-line tool. It is fully automatic and easy to use --- users input
an image, and MASS will output the extracted brain and the associated brain mask.
